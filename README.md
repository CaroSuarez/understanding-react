# understanding-react

In this project I played around with different little examples to be able to understand in deph a lot of important tools that ReactJS offers such as HOCs and Hooks.

## memo HOC

Watches the props of a component. In any prop changes the memo HOC prevents the component to render again.

## useCallback hook

Save a function reference
